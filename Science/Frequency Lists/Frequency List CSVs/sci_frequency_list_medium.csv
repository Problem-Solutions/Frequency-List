One group of compounds whose concentrations rise in response to this process includes serum amyloid A and C-reactive protein--those are APRs. This process is stimulated when C3a and C5a cause one type of cell to degranulate. One class of drugs used to inhibit this process work by inhibiting a cyclo-oxygenase which seeks to convert arachidonic acid into a type of eicosanoid known as the prostaglandins. This process is initiated when ,0

"Two members of this family cause an infant disease also known as sixth disease, roseola. Another member of this family causes benign lymph node tumors in Castleman's disease, though it was first identified as the causative agent of blotchy lesions often found on the face of AIDS patients. Besides Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated, another member of its gamma subfamily causes Burkett's Lymphoma, while members of its alpha subfamily lie dormant in nerves between outbreaks. For 10 points, name this virus family including the Epstein-Barr virus and the chicken pox-causing Varicella zoster, whose types 1 and 2,",0
