# Quizbowl-Frequency-List
This program creates a frequency list of Fine Arts answer lines, stratified by tournament difficulty

The goal of this program is to take a file of fine arts quizbowl questions and create three frequency lists: one for easy 
  tournaments, one for medium-difficulty tournaments, and one for hard tournaments. The questions were downloaded from 
  quizlet.com.
