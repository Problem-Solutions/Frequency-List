"The origin of one part of this action is found in the fourth section of the an-Nissa surah. This action is considered the ""muftah al Jennah"" and is performed after the rise from the sujood of the last rak'ah. In one sect, performing this action is preceded by stating ""At-Tahiyyatu lillahi,"" while acknowledging the ""Wali"" of Allah is essential to the Shi'a version. One must meet the seven conditions of earnestness before meaningfully doing this. All humans are born with fitra associated with this action, so conservatives call people who perform it for the first time in front of another Muslim reverts rather than converts. For 10 points, name this pillar of Islam which is the declaration that there is no god but Allah.",0

"One chapter of a book specific to this sect recounts a story about a man who gets stung by the evil eye after seeing a shooting star blaze through the sky. This sect forbade the construction of tombs in burial sites and consider many doctrines developed during the ""state of ignorance"" to be nothing more than ""reprehensible innovations."" Some members of this school deem as ""bid'a"" the usage of prayer beads, probably because of the garish ebony prayer beads used by sultans. Soldiers of this sect formed a national guard called the Ikhwan, united against such idolatries celebrating the birthday of the Prophet. They emphasize the absolute oneness of God,",0
