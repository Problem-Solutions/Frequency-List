Question: At the gate of Samaria in front of Jehoshaphat, Zedekiah made some of these objects from iron and proclaimed that he would attack the Arameans. In Ezekiel, the Lord says that on the day when Nebuchadnezzar conquered Egypt, this object of Israel will spring forth, whereas Psalm 132 says that the one of David would blossom.

Question: Many accounts trace the beginning of this religious sect to a scholar named Huiyan, who called together a group of monks and laymen, and was posthumously called the "First Patriarch" of this belief for his attempt to establish independent monasteries during the Eastern Jin dynasty.

Question: Pope John Paul II claimed that this figure o€ffers "an invitation to meditate on the paradoxical refusal of his merciful love." The story of this figure was skipped during early Greek celebrations of Pentecost. Because Eusebius asserted that the story of this figure was presented by Papias as part of the Gospel of the Hebrews, Joseph Lightfoot argued that it was interpolated. Bruce Metzger claimed that Euthymius Zigabenus was the first theologian to discuss this gure, whose story immediately precedes the declaration, "I am the light of the world." Saint Ambrose proposed that another figure writes "terra terram accusat" on the ground with his finger aˆfter encountering this subject of John 7:53-8:11.

Question: Brian Tierney has written a study on the historical origins of this doctrine; he argues that it can be traced back to the scholarly writings of Peter Olivi. A book rejecting this idea was published by Hans Kung in 1971, and led him to be stripped of his license to teach Catholic theology. Protestant opponents of this principle oˆen cite the Three Chapters Controversy as evidence. Defended early on by Robert Bellarmine, this doctrine was formally defined in a constitution called Pastor Aeternus, which was denounced by opponents as part of the heresy of Ultramontanism when it was issued by the First Vatican Council. This idea was invoked by Pius XII when he defined the Assumption of Mary as an article of faith, and this doctrine allows for the possibility of speaking ex cathedra.

In another section, it states that since you have become "dull of hearing" you need "milk and not solid food."

Question: Alternate forms of this ritual object include the "kikar" and the "rakik."

In order to be "yotzei," or compliant, with requirements involving it, a follower must surpass a unit known as a "k'zait" and which derives from varying interpretations on the size of objects obtained by the biblical "meraglim," the spies from Deuteronomy. Prior to usage of this object, one conducts the "netilat yadayim" and says the "ha-motzi" blessing, and afterwards recites "birkat ha'mazon," with additional blessings if he is with at least two or nine other males.

Question: Early guidelines for this practice were authored by Andrea Alciati, while Girolamo Muzio's 1550 treatise on this practice was the most popular of its time. In its 24th session, the Congress of Trent condemned this practice, branding it a "detestable custom... [which] shall be uprooted from Christian soil." Fracois de Montmorency-Bouteville was executed by Louis XIII for engaging in this practice, which had been outlawed by Henry IV in 1608. This practice also came under attack from the jurist Jean de Savaron, who had argued that it was responsible for twice as many deaths as the French Wars of Religion, while Montesquieu's Persian Letters satirized this practice as the only way for French aristocrats to resolve differences arising from a "point of honor." The prevalence of this practice in post-Elizabethan England may have come from both an inflation of honors and the proliferation of rapiers, and those engaging in this practice were typically accompanied by a "second."

Question: One year after its passage, this legislation withstood a direct constitutional challenge in the Katzenbach case. Among the provisions of this legislation was a triggering clause that required federal pre-clearance of procedural changes.

This speech repeatedly mocks a senator's policy of "care not," and contrasts his stated indifference with those who "do care for the result." It uses the metaphor of "a lot of framed timbers" crafted by different workmen, which "exactly matte the frame of a house or a mill, all the tenons and mortices exactly fitting," to describe a conspiracy planned by "Stephen and Franklin and Roger and James." This speech begins "If we could first know where we are, and whither we are tending, we could then better judge what to do, and how to do it," and claims that the Dred Scott decision is a culmination of a plot to legalize slavery in all states.

Question: The Qur'an gives its name as tariq which in the Sufi tradition means "deliverer of messages". In Norse mythology, it is called Aurvandil because Aurvandil's wife Groa cured Thor of a horn stuck in his head.

In Greek mythology, it refers to Eosphorus, a son of Eos, who is scientifically the same object as his nocturnal twin Hesperus.
