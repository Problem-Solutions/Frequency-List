"A temple to Ptolemy VI was built as a double temple with axes leading to the sanctuaries of Horus and this deity and was located at Kom Ombo. This god's mother was the patroness of the city of Sais and was traditionally shown wearing a red crown and a bow and crossed arrows. The son of Neith, he was honored with the new name of the city of Arsinoe. This god was represented by a live creature known as Petsuchos. In the Book of the Dead, this god assisted in the birth of Horus, and he rescued the children of Horus with a fishing net. Additionally, this god carried Osiris on his back following Osiris' death and saved Osiris' hands with a fish trap. For 10 points, name this Egyptian god who was represented as a crocodile.",0

"In Algonquin lore, these creatures include Mikchich, the uncle of Glooskap. In the Iroquois creation myth, Sky Woman lands on one of these creatures; thus the Iriquois call North America this creature's ""island."" A golden one of these creatures gave the sword ""Heaven's Will"" to the Vietnamese hero Le Loi. In China, a black one of these creatures is the sacred animal of the north. An example of these animals, which kept Mount Mandara from sinking during the churning of the ocean of milk, was Kurma, the second avatar of Vishnu. For 10 points, name this long-lived reptile which, in many Asian cosmologies, supports some number of elephants who in turn hold up the world.",0
