Question: J.L. Austin defined this property as the correlation between demonstrative and descriptive conventions. A paper titled for this concept uses three-value logic to create "fixed-point semantics". A 1933 paper defines this property as holding for X if and only if X appears in a metalanguage. Bertrand Russell used the sentence "Bishop Stubbs was hanged for murder" to attack a definition of this as "coherence". Late in life, Heidegger rejected his own definition of this property as "disclosedness" or "aletheia". Kripke wrote an "Outline to a Theory of" this property, of which Tarski introduced a "semantic conception". The problem of self-reference and this property is called the "liar's paradox".

Question: This philosopher rejected the internal consistency of Plato's account of the fable of Gyges' ring in a work in which a Christian, an Epicurean and a Stoic debate what is the highest good. In his major work of language, this humanist, who authored De Vero Bono, quotes thirty pages of Quintilian's Institutio Oratoria since he has nothing new to add about the various forms of argumentation. He wrote a three-volume project that attempted to refute the grammars of Priscian, Donatus and Servius as well as the scholasticism of Aristotle titled The Reploughing of Dialectic and Philosophy. As a philologist, he authored a handbook on the Latin language titled Elegantiae linguae Latinae; interest in that language led him to author another a treatise that argued a certain Roman ruler must have hid his true nature from his relatives and friends if Pope Sylvester I was really given authority over the entirety of the Western Roman Empire.

Question: The study of this topic was partially reshaped by Louis Mink, who considered its various uses in "Narrative Form as a Cognitive Instrument." A book about this subject has an epigraph from Gaston Bachelard's The Psychoanalysis of Fire stating "One can only study what one has dreamed about." That book analyzes this topic using the literary modes of Northrop Frye's Anatomy of Criticism. An essay on this topic proposes that various intellectuals approach this subject using either the antiquarian, monumental or critical methods. Hayden White wrote a "meta-study" of this subject, whose "use and abuse" is discussed in an untimely meditation by Friedrich Nietzsche. In the 19th century, Thomas Carlyle proposed the "great man theory" of this topic, which is imagined to proceed through the age of gods, the age of heroes and the age of men in The New Science.

Question: This hypothetical act titles a book by Ramona Naddaff, which argues that it is actually an act of cultural and aesthetic discussion. Iris Murdoch's The Fire and the Sun defends this actionon the grounds that it is easier to copy a bad man than a good man. The so-called "psychological critique" defends this act by citing how art nourishes the irrational part of the soul. The "metaphysical critique" which defends this act uses the example of God creating the Form of furniture, a carpenter creating furniture, and finally, a painter making a representation of a bed. This suggested action seems to contradict itself, since it is immediately followed by the most imaginative portion of the dialogue, the story of the Myth of Er. For 10 points, name this act that occurs at the beginning of the tenth book of Plato's Republic, in which Socrates suggests the removal of members of a certain occupation from the polis.

This concept is held to be the "arbiter of one half our actions" according to an author who suggested that virtu, or man's force, can oppose, but not ultimately conquer this concept. In another work, songs titled "Nero's Infamy" and "Glory May Not Last" precede discussions in which the title figure analogizes this idea to an inconstant game. Niccolo Machiavelli suggested that it needs to be "beaten and coerced" like a woman in the twenty-fifth chapter of The Prince.

Question: These entities are the primary philosophical subject of Tom Regan, and the eponymous "Issue" of these entities is the subject of a book by Peter Carruthers, who argues that these entities generate no direct moral claims. In a paper titled "Thought and Talk," Donald Davidson used an intensionality test to argue for the absence of propositional attitudes in these entities. Christine Korsgaard has argued for a moral duty towards these entities, in contradiction to Kant's position in a section Lectures on Ethics that we have only "indirect duties" towards these entities. The actions of these entities should always be interpreted in terms of lower-level rather than higher level cognitive functions according to Morgan's canon, and an argument in favor of granting these beings additional rights is known as the "argument from marginal cases." A 1975 philosophical work regarding these beings makes a utilitarian case for their rights partly based on the aƒffirmative answer to Bentham's question "Can they suff€er?"

Question: Jan van Hoo€ analyzed how the "relaxed open-mouth display" in chimps evolved into this type of face to signal mockaggression rather than a real fight. A story o€ffered as an example of this concept describes prison guards who allow a convict to play cards with them, but, when they catch him cheating, kick him out of prison. An essay claims that this action arises when one sees machine-like movement in the human body and argues that it operates as a "social reaction which punishes" and corrects deviant behavior. Another essay argues that this phenomenon releases nervous energy in safe physical movements that "have no object," and an examination of "Der Witz" argues that it releases the psychic energy of repressed emotions. Schopenhauer defined it as "the sudden perception of the incongruity between a concept and the real objects," and Herbert Spencer wrote a study on the "physiology" of this behavior that o€ffers a representative view of the relief theory of this concept.

Question: A critique of this concept's popularizer which itself is named aˆer this concept was written by Max Scheler, who argued that the thinker who popularized this concept applied it inappropriately. This concept, if it appears in a noble man, does not "poison" him because it "consummates and exhausts itself in an immediate reaction," according to another work. Another work by this concept's originator argues that though this concept is "born of weakness," it is "most harmful for the weak themselves," and attributes the author's freedom from this concept to a "protracted sickness." The work which most famously discusses this concept calls it the "inversion of the value-positing eye" and that when it "becomes creative and gives birth to values," it brings about "the slave revolt in morality." For 10 points, identify this concept extensively discussed by Nietzsche in both Ecce Homo and On the GenealoŠgy of Morals, a French word signifying the envy and hatred of the weak for the strong that results in the creation of the concept of evil.

Question: A 1965 book by Arthur Danto was titled aˆer the "Analytical Philosophy of" this idea, and according to Danto's own analysis 30 years later, was inspired by Carl Hempel's work on the philosophy of this concept. Johann Gottfried von Herder's major work on this concept focused on the "innerness" of those involved in it, and was titled This Too a Philosophy of this idea. One philosopher advocated a "Baconian" approach to this concept in his major book, The Idea of this concept, while a diff€erent philosopher argued in his major work that this concept proceeds via the interaction of "productive systems,". Those thinkers are, respectively, R.G. Collingwood and Willhelm Dilthey. In an essay titled aˆer the "concept" of this idea, Walter Benjamin wrote that "the consciousness of exploding the continuum" of this idea is "peculiar to the revolutionary classes in the moment of their action," and suggested that Klee's Angelus Novus is an apt representation of this concept.

Question: According to Girolamo Cardano's treatise "On Gaining Advantage from Misfortunes," we only have hope of this philosophical doctrine, because certainty in this doctrine would lead men into delusions of grandeur. In his most famous work, Pietro Pomponazzi argued that this philosophical doctrine was probably false, and Georg Friedrich Meier's most famous work argues that the truth of this doctrine is unknowable. This position was advocated for in a work consisting of three dialogues which argued that if this philosophical doctrine was false, then the state had the right to demand that a citizen sacrifice his life for it. That work, whose argument was criticized by Kant on the grounds that its subject was capable of being diminished to nothingness by degrees, was written by Moses Mendelssohn.

Question: In a 2008 work intended to be a "revisiting" of the original work in which this concept appeared, this concept's originator identied pragmatism as the "enemy par excellence" of his project. Andy Clark criticized this concept for trading on a "confused reliance on the idea of a symbol's physical presence." In the article "Connectionism and Cognitive Architecture," the originator of this concept argued that the "architecture of the mind is not a connectionist network," partly due to the systematicity inherent in understanding both the phrase "John loves the girl," and "the girl loves John." The work which introduced this concept argued that all cognitive processes are computational, and argues contra Wittgenstein that a private language is not only possible but must exist; that work lays out some evidence for the existence of the "internal code" which is supposed to make up the data structures required by this concept. For 10 points, identify this concept according to which cognitive processes are realized by a symbolic system together with syntactic operations over tokens, introduced by Jerry Fodor in a 1975 book of the same name

Question: In an interview, Robert Brandom argued that this concept was an "attempt to show that asymmetric recognitive relations are metaphysically defective." Simone de Beauvoir explicitly drew on this concept in the first chapter of Part II of The Second Sex to explain gender relations. In his commentary on the philosopher who introduced this idea, Alexander Kojeve argued that this concept, viewed as a struggle for "recognition," was central to its formulator's philosophy, and that its resolution would bring about "the end of history." First introduced in its formulator's The System of Ethical Life, the work in which this concept was explicitly outlined claims that "self-consciousness exists in itself and for itself," and that one figure referenced by this idea "is mediated with itself through another consciousness;" thus, the first figure is independent, while the second is dependent. For 10 points, identify this key concept which shares its name with the passage from Hegel's PhenomenologyŠ of Spirit in which it's introduced, and which explores the interdependence of the two titular types of individuals.

Question: In an essay published on the fiftˆieth anniversary of the introduction of these concepts, Fred Dretske broke these concepts into two independent assumptions, and argued that for many philosophers, rejecting the closure principle that is the second assumption, brings "Armageddon." In order to address the critique presented by these concepts, Ernest Sosa formulated the triple-A criteria, which assess an action based on accuracy, adroitness, and aptness. In his book Thought, Gilbert Harman formulated the "no false lemmas" reply to the objections raised by these concepts, and Roderick Chisholm's most famous work used the concept of something being "evident" to counteract the critique originated by the formulator of these concepts. The paper which first formulated these concepts presented one of them in which Smith infers that Brown is in Barcelona on the grounds that Jones owns a Ford. Formulated to give a negative answer to that paper's title, "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?" for 10 points, identify these seemingly paradoxical epistemic scenarios formulated by the namesake American philosopher.

Question: A historically distinctive feature of this work's philosophy is its claim that while we do not have innate conceptions of things such as musical tones, we do possess innate conceptions of goodness. In a section "on sophistical arguments," this work suggests that an inference from premises should be admitted only if the premises at the end of the argument are the same as those that were initially granted. This work provides a tripartite definition of being good, which includes mastery of desires and aversions, movement toward and away from things, and freedom from deception and rashness. This work, whose third book contains an argument between an Epicurean and the man whose thought is contained in it, consists chiefl‚y of prescriptions for the good life, and begins with a description "Of the things which are in our power, and not in our power." The central points of this philosophical work would be summarized aˆfter the death of the man whose thought it contains by his student Arian into a short work known as the Manual, or the Enchiridion. For 10 points, identify this four-volume philosophical work containing the teachings of the Stoic Epictetus.

Question: The American philosopher Alexander Bryan Johnson proposed an "operational" theory of this concept, which partly titles his 1854 work about this idea. In his Mind and the World Order, C.I. Lewis outlined four modes of this concept, which he further divided between "holophrastic" and "analytic" instantiations. Michael Dummett published two essays both asking in the title, "What is a theory of," this concept, in which he argued against the truth-conditional theory of this idea. In a 1957 paper titled only by this concept, H.P. Grice argued that in order to fully understand this concept, the utterer's intentions must be taken into account. Hilary Putnam's "Twin Earth" thought experiment was intended to show that this concept "ain't just in the head," a position known as semantic externalism. For 10 points, identify this property of a sentence which indicates the content the speaker wishes to express, and which, used twice, completes the title of Putnam's "Twin Earth" paper.

Question: A philosophical article by Fred Feldman distinguished between the "propositional" and the "sensory" forms of this concept, and was titled "Two Questions about" this phenomenon. In section 84 of A Theory of Justice, John Rawls argues that this concept cannot constitute the single rational end that is intended to guide deliberations. In his Theory of Moral Sentiments, Adam Smith argued that nothing generates this phenomenon quite like observing in others "a fellow feeling with all the emotions of our own breast." Henry Sidgwick argued that the only thing that the various instances of this phenomenon had in common was that they were all desirable, and thus proposed to define a measure of this phenomenon in terms of individual preferences in his The Methods of Ethics. Robert Nozick's argument against utilitarianism relied on our purported hesitation to plug ourselves into an "experience machine" that produced this phenomenon in unlimited amounts. Increasing the prevalence of this phenomenon was the basic idea behind Bentham's felicific calculus. For 10 points, identify this human emotion promoted by hedonistic philosophies.

Question: In the opening section from Beyond Good and Evil, "On the Prejudices of Philosophers," Nietzsche argues that along with "immediate certainty," and "absolute knowledge." this concept represents a contradiction. Otto Liebmann's seminal work on the originator of this concept argued that this concept must be abandoned in order to preserve the philosophical system developed by its originator. In an appendix to his own David Hume on Faith, Friedrich Jacobi criticized this concept by claiming that without it, he was unable to understand its originator's system, but with it, he could not remain within that system. Book II, Chapter 18 of Schopenhauer'sWorld as Will and Idea is titled aftˆer the "Possibility of Knowing," this concept, which in much of Schopenhauer's work is typically identified with the Will or an aspect of it. The work in which this concept first appears repeatedly claims that this concept is unknowable through "mere relations" or "external sense," which only provides us with a representation. For 10 points, identify this concept developed in Kant's Critique of Pure Reason which is sometimes identified with the noumenon and is distinguished from the phenomenon, or things as they appear to us.

Question: Along with Montesquieu, this philosopher was the subject of much of Althusser's thought in the late 1950s, which culminated in Althusser's publication in 1960 of an essay on this thinker's "Philosophical Manifestoes." This thinker argued for a new philosophy grounded in sensation in opposition to Cartesian rationalism in his Principles for the Philosophy of the Future, and his late work, including the essay "On Spiritualism and Materialism," and the book On Moral Philosophy, was chiefl‚y concerned with the drive towards happiness. This philosopher was heavily criticized by Max Stirner in The Ego and His Own for bringing about only a "theoretical liberation," which only resulted in a "change of masters," and by Bruno Bauer, a fellow Young Hegelian, who attacked this thinker in an essay titled aˆer this man's "Characteristics." This thinker's most famous work draws heavily on D.F. Strauss' The Life of Jesus Critically Examined and claims that "theology is anthropology."

Question: An article whose title proclaims a new interpretation of this phenomenon considers two parties dubbed "ego" and "alter," and was expanded into Social Theory of International Politics; that essay is a foundational text of constructivism by Alexander Wendt. This concept is advanced by "superstitious faith... in machinery," and distinguished from "Fenianism," in a work that berates Nonconformists in the chapter "Our Liberal Practitioners" and contrasts "Hebraism" with "Hellenism." A utopian "post-scarcity" variant of this phenomenon was envisioned in a book by Murray Bookchin, and its "communistic" version was advocated in the book The Conquest of Bread by a man who also wrote the 1910 Encyclopedia Britannica article on this concept, Peter Kropotkin. This is the first title concept in a work which uses the example of people paying to see Wilt Chamberlain play basketball to argue against egalitarian theories, such as those advanced by John Rawls in his A Theory of Justice.

Question: This work's opening chapter argues that "it is madness to make the fate of thousands depend on the caprice of a weak fellow creature whose very station sinks him necessarily below the meanest of his subjects." This work's ninth chapter opens with the assertion that "from the respect paid to property fl‚ow... most of the evils," and draws a parallel between its subjects and "modern soldier[s]." In its eighth chapter, the author argues that excessive "respect for the opinion of the world," actually undermines morality, which should instead be determined by examining one's conduct only when God's presence is felt. The fiftˆh chapter criticizes James Fordyce, the author of a popular series of sermons, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau for the views expressed in Emile. This work's title reprises an earlier letter to Edmund Burke in response to Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France.

Question: A chapter about the meaning of this term distinguishes between its predicative and attributive uses and notes that one of its attributive uses is doubly relative, and that philosophy should be concerned with the predicative use. This is the second title concept of a book which argues that the proper course of action in a given situation is determined by a set of prima facie duties. That book is by W. D. Ross, and discusses another philosopher's distinction between the "ultimate" and "intrinsic" forms of this property.

This paper distinguishes between questions of facts and questions of arrangements of facts in asking whether a diamond surrounded by cotton can be considered hard. This essay compares the distinction between immediate and mediate consciousness to the relationship between notes and airs and uses the notion of path to explain the "parallelogram of forces." It suggests rejecting a certain "ornament of logic," and claims that realizing that our conception of an object's practical e€ffects is the whole of our conception of the object is the "third grade of clearness of apprehension."

Question: In this work's dedication, the author notes that if he "had to make the choice of the place" of his birth, he would have "preferred a society which had an extent proportionate to the limits of the human faculties." This work claims that man is diff€erent from beast because of his ability to improve at will, an attribute known as "perfectibility." A contrast in this work is drawn between the kind of man who is self-suffiƒcient and acts in accordance with his natural instinct, and the kind of man who is led astray because his reason turns against him and engenders egocentrism. This work contrasts a love of self that functions as self-preservation and a self-love that is dependent on how one is perceived by others, and its second part argues that "the first man who, having enclosed a piece of ground, bethought himself of saying 'This is mine,"' was the "real founder of civil society."

Question: A Lawrence Shapiro article titled aˆer this concept considers the example of a pair of corkscrews and compares the causal contribution of their material versus their color. David Lewis argued that this idea is not inconsistent with its opposite if it is made domain specific, using the example of a lottery having diff€erent winning numbers in diff€erent weeks. Arguments against this idea include the "denying projectability" reply, which uses the example of jade, and one which notes that this idea allows local structure-specifc bridge laws; those replies were formulated by Jaegwon Kim. This idea was generalized to occur within a single token system by Jerry Fodor, who used it to show that the special sciences cannot be reduced to physics. This idea was introduced in a series of papers attacking the identity thesis by Hilary Putnam, who considered the fact that many diff€erent kinds of animals feel pain, and is generally conceived of as a challenge to psychophysical reductionism.

Question: This philosopher reworked his paper "The Idea of Public Reason Revisited" into the second half of a book laying out eight principles for interactions among nations. This philosopher cited Kenneth Arrow to argue that good institutions form through a "four-stage sequence" of prior philosophizing, constitution-formation, legislature-selection, and bureaucracy-creation. This author of The Law of Peoples rejected utilitarian measurements of happiness, instead creating a list of "primary goods" valued by citizens, whom he argued possessed "two moral powers" that include following a "conception of the good." Michael Sandel criticized this philosopher's Kantian approach in a book on the "limits" of his most famous subject. This philosopher argued that without prior knowledge, people would maximize the amount of utility accorded to those lowest in status, in a thought experiment in which humans engineer society from behind a "veil of ignorance."

Question: One section of this work argues that Hegel demoted this work's title concept to a mere "means of education," and credits Marx for restoring the idea of this work's title concept as the "subjection of political domination... to reason." This work's 15th section criticizes Mill and Tocqueville for "devalu[ing] the consequences" of a process they favored for the sake of principle, and it traces the beginnings of the title event partly to the Tory opposition in the 1720s. This work is critical of modern democracies and welfare states for allowing their citizenry to develop "a general attitude of demand," which subsumes genuine political interests under "administrative acts," thereby leading to a degeneration of the title concept. Tracing the origins of the title concept to modern understanding of the concept of a "private" citizen, this work analyzes the rise and fall of "coffee houses" and "salons" as the central loci of the title concept, which the author fears has been undermined by a transition from "culture-debating" to "culture-consuming."

Question: This book's universality was attacked by Heidegger in the Davos debate, and its so-called "principle of significance" was attacked in Peter Strawson's The Bounds of Sense. This book compares logic to a courtyard in its B-preface, written six years after its A-preface. It says that we comprehend a "manifold" of sense-data via the "unity of apperception," and claims that space and time exist as "forms of intuition" in our heads. Its author simplified its four sets of contradictory "antinomies," and its split between phenomena and imperceptible noumena, for his Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics.

He defined "reason" as the mathematical reckoning of the consequences of agreed-upon names, and defined "right" as the liberty to make use of that faculty of reason. This philosopher, who wrote a treatise attacking the experiments of Robert Boyle, used the term "manners" to describe actions that allow men to live in peace in unity, these actions being forms of (*) "motion", which he believed to be the universal cause of all things. These definitions, some of which he originally formulated in De Homine and De Cive, were included in a work that advocates forming a Christian commonwealth to escape from the state of nature, which is "the war of all against all".

Another thinker attacked "ersatzist" theories of them in a book that distanced itself from the view of these as maximally consistent sets of propositions. These things are related to one another through accessibility relations, and a set of them with a set of accessibility relations forms a (*) frame. Counterpart theory holds objects can only exist in one of these; that theory was developed by David Lewis in his book "on the plurality" of these entities.

Question: This philosopher argued against the possibility of an unordered universe with the analogy of deriving a function whose graph traces over randomly drawn points. He used the example of Alexander the Great to argue that a substance was a concept complete enough to allow all of its possible predicates to be deduced from it, and that consequently, any substance mirrors the properties of the entire universe. This man argued that for any (*) identical objects, any property of one is shared by the other, which is sometimes called his law. This author of Discourse on Metaphysics divided truths into "truths of reason," which rested on the principle of contradiction, and "truths of fact" which relied on a principle he described in his correspondence with Samuel Clarke: his principle of sufficient reason.

Question: John McDowell endorsed this thinker's view that raw experiences are endowed with rational content, allowing a spontaneous mind to still be receptive to empirical facts. A commentary on one of his works rejects most of it, but agrees that any self-conscious being aware of experiences must also be aware of objective realities, rebutting skepticism. In The Bounds of Sense, P.F. Strawson contends that (*) "transcendental deduction" is this man's most important contribution. Arthur Schopenhauer included an appendix of this thinker's errors in The World as Will and Representation, but also compared reading this man's writings to "a cataract operation on a blind person."

It argues that knowledge based on resemblance was replaced after the Renaissance by knowledge based on identity and difference. This book's preface describes its author's laughing response to a fictional Chinese encyclopedia that divides animals into absurd categories like "drawn with a...camelhair brush" in a passage by (*) Borges. It argues that fields such as natural history and general grammar are not ancestors of modern biology and linguistics, because all knowledge is limited to the episteme of its era.

This thinker is taught that sensations are really mathematical points that our perception extends into surfaces, in an extended dialogue between himself and a Spirit that appears to him at midnight in a work divided into three books titled "Doubt", "Knowledge", and "Faith". He argued that the two possible foundations of philosophy were the pure (*) thinghood of Kant, which he labeled as a dogmatic form of realism, and the pure selfhood of his own philosophy, which he labeled as the true "transcendental idealism" apart from Kant's, and which is founded on the action of the self positing itself.

Genus, matter, universal, and essence are proposed as definitions of substance in Book 7, the last chapter of which declares a "new beginning" in examining its question. That chapter explains that a house is different from bricks and stones due to a cause, which the author equates with form; this illustrates its author's concept of (*) hylomorphism.

Question: Anthony Kenny argued against viewing one part of this argument as skepticism about memory in his criticism of Norman Malcolm's analysis of it. Another work compares this argument to Hume's solution to the problem of causation, claiming that it shows how ordinary practices do not require the justification we think, even if we concede the impossibility of truth-conditions. The claim that this is a "skeptical solution to the skeptic's paradox" appears in a book that opens with the example of the (*) "quus function" and argues that it is a corollary of a larger argument about rule-following. That book is by Saul Kripke. The reader is asked to imagine a person who writes "S" every time he feels a sensation in its original formulation in Philosophical Investigations.

Question: One work distinguishes this concept from lust, by suggesting that this concept does not impel us to possess an object. Francis Hutcheson argued that this concept arises through the possession of "uniformity amidst variety". One thinker claimed that to apply this concept is to simultaneously demand agreement while admitting of disinterest in an object's real existence. This concept titles a book that distinguishes between work and (*) play, to separate moral value from valuing this concept, which is discussed as "the manifestation of God to the senses". One work claims that this concept stems from sympathy and the "social passions", and contrasts it with a concept that instills a feeling of terror or awe. George Santayana defined it as "the objectification of pleasure" in a work title for The Sense of this concept.

Question: A movement named for this event was sparked by a 1961 book, in which the argument that it arose from the absence of transcendence in the modern world was put forth by Gabriel Vahanian. Charles Taylor claimed that belief in this event is one of the dominant modern "closed world structures," which arises from both contemporary moral experience and scientific advancement, and that belief in it arises from the belief that the "immanent frame" is all-containing. G.W.F. Hegel claimed that this event signified a "reversal" and "the negation of negation." Despite this event, shadows will continue to be exhibited in caves "for millenniums yet"; in another text, which wonders what "festivals of atonement" or "sacred games" must be invented in the wake of this event, a madman alleges that all of humanity was responsible for it.

Question: This book illustrates a concept whose only norm is sophrosune with an artistic description of the top half of Raphael's Transfiguration. This book, which compares ancient "cheerfulness" with Schiller's modern "naivete," cites Gotthold Lessing's refusal to receive perfect knowledge from God to attack the "theoretical man." Ulrich Wilamowitz made his career with an attack on this book. It quotes Schopenhauer's description of a sailor in a storm illustrating the principium individuationis and uses "the phenomenon," or maya, and the mask as equivalents for a concept it identifies with illusion. This book argues that the dialogue of a play and its chorus, respectively, belong to the realms of "dreams" and "drunkenness." The author called this book "dubious" and links its writing to the tumult of the Franco-Prussian War in an 1886 "Attempt at Self-Criticism."

Question: The nomological varieties of this concept are enumerated as material, consequentialist, and inclusive in a paper by Ernest Sosa. In a 1986 paper, another thinker argued that any theory that explains this concept must also explain the "chancy" type of it by using the example of a bomb hooked up to a Geiger counter. A book by John Mackie that examines statistical laws and their relationship to this concept is titled Cement of the Universe; that book refutes David Lewis's attempt to explain this concept with conditional counterfactuals and proposes "regularity" theory as an explanation for this idea. Another argument about this idea suggests that humans understand it inductively only through instances of the "copy principle," by using the example of one billiard ball hitting another billiard ball. For 10 points, name this concept articulated as a "necessary connection" in David Hume's An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, which can be used to explain the relationship between two events.

The prologue to this text opens by citing Matthew 19:28, in a discussion of why one should not judge. It analyzes Boethius's claim in the Topics that accident and substance were the two "primary kinds of things" and develops an argument about the prevalence of "opinion." This text adopts the dialectical approach of Gratian in a section that opens with the inquiry of whether human faith must be "completed by reason" and goes on to ask whether faith only concerns unseen things, and whether there is any knowledge of unseen things. It states that if "God permits errors to befall the saints themselves, this occurs in matters which do no harm to the faith," and presents 158 questions in an attempt to resolve inconsistencies between church fathers.

Question: This philosophical position was influentially stated in a 1956 paper by John Kemeny and Paul Oppenheim. The champions of this position's "new wave" include Clifford Hooker and John Bickle. Another influential model of this position, which was amended by Kenneth Schaffner, distinguishes between homogeneous and heterogeneous forms of this position's central concept, and relies on derivations assisted by bridge laws. In The Structure of Science, Ernest Nagel set forth his model of this position. Dan Dennett's book Darwin's Dangerous Idea supports a form of this position that attempts to explain apparent design without "skyhooks," rather than without "cranes." The argument from multiple realizability opposes this position, which is attacked along with the analytic-synthetic distinction in W.V.O. Quine's "Two Dogmas of Empiricism." For 10 points, name this philosophical doctrine stating that complex phenomena can be fully explained in terms of lower-level phenomena.

Question: The two central figures of this text are compared to "two bald men searching for a comb" in Soren Kierkegaard's dissertation. The first paragraph of J. S. Mill's Utilitarianism cites this text as foundational. It claims that pleasure is the good and one cannot be overcome by good, so the state of being "overcome by pleasure" can only result from ignorance. One man in this text describes how all species but humans received a special power at creation because Epimetheus forgot. Several men lift the ailing Prodicus out of bed in this text, in which the poetic lines from Simonides, "for a man to become good is truly hard" and "hard it is to be good," are contrasted. This dialogue is set in the house of Callias, and concludes with Socrates undermining his own argument by stating that the central concept is knowledge, and knowledge can be learned. For 10 points, name this Platonic dialogue in which Socrates debates whether virtue can be taught with a Sophist who claimed that "man is the measure of all things."

Question: This thinker used the equality of the three sides of a triangle as an example of a situation in which there is no connection between conceptions and judgments, but merely between sides and angles. He included two diagrams of the human eye in the fourth chapter of a book arguing that coexistence is only possible through the union of time and space. He discussed the "subject in volition" as the immediate object of inner sense in a book, inspired by Aristotle's explanatory doctrines, that posits "willing," "being," "knowing," and "becoming" as necessary connections with the different classes of objects it identifies. He appended a critique of the transcendental analytic in Kantian philosophy to a later book in which he connected the Kantian ding-an-sich with the human will. For 10 points, name this thinker who built on his dissertation, On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, to write The World as Will and Representation.

Question: An article that tries to explain the limits of this concept advocates transcendental naturalism and introduces the idea of cognitive closure to argue that humans are incapable of ever articulating this concept. A book on this topic that advocates "constructive naturalism" to explain "The Missing Shade of You" was written by Owen Flanagan and is named for this concept "reconsidered." The unknowability of this concept is accepted by New Mysterians, which is promoted by sexual harasser Colin McGinn, who talks about this concept in The Mysterious Flame. Joseph Levine argues that a physical substrate is potentially necessary to understand this idea in a paper that introduces "the explanatory gap." A science of this concept using first-person and third-person data is advocated by David Chalmers, who also introduced the "hard" form of the "problem" of this concept. For 10 points, a philosophical problem requires an explanation of what state of being aware?

Question: In a letter to St. Denis, this thinker used the term sygkephalaiosis to describe his belief that those who receive a miracle have just consummated their relationship with God. In one of this thinker's works, he likened the image of God to the most vile of creatures, a worm. In that same work, he compared the secrets of God to the mystery of a secret object wrapped in light that is wrapped in darkness. Another of this thinker's works uses the example of Moses on Mount Sinai to argue that once one learns the divine secrets, one only knows silence and unknowing. Another of this man's works posits that the church is inhabited by eight types of people, the lowest of whom are the "demon-possessed."

Question: A controversy over this man's religious thought prompted a pamphlet on David Hume's use of a word for "belief." That word, "glaube," was roundly derided in an 18th-century controversy about this man's thought sparked by a conversation about him between Gotthold Lessing and Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, the latter of whom maintained that this man was a materialist. In his own time, he was castigated for pointing out that the Bible is "imperfect, corrupt, erroneous, and inconsistent with itself," and fragmentary. In this man's major text on religion, he claimed that the persistence of Jews as a race was mainly due to their fastidiousness in requiring circumcision, and that the Torah should not be followed because it was only fit to serve as the state constitution of ancient Israel. This man's central religious belief was of "Deus sive Natura," signifying his belief that nature and God consisted of one and the same substance.

Question: In a book named for these things, one of them called "The Curse of the Cauliflower" is used by the author to show that isolating subjective experiences, such as the way a particular food tastes to someone, is impossible. In that 1995 book, the author claimed that another of these constructs is the talent that people have for interpreting the people around them, which is called "folk psychology." In a book about "The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting," the author argues that Rene Descartes's "cogito ergo sum" statement is one of these concepts that has beguiled philosophy for 300 years. These concepts were first introduced in the book Elbow Room, which stated that a thought experiment proposed by John Searle, the Chinese Room experiment, is one of them because it appeals to the imagination instead of presenting a soundly derived arguments from principles.

Question: This work is the first title subject of a 1963 commentary by J.L. Ackrill, who proposed that it was written by iteratively asking questions. Immanuel Kant, who claimed that this work's author "picked up" the title concepts "as they occurred to him," expanded on this work to propose four "pure concepts of understanding" that form the basis of his "table of judgments." Chapters 5 through 9 of this work focus on "ta lagomena," or "things that are said," and expand on a ten-fold list that consists of "when," "where," "having," "doing," "relative," "qualification," "being affected," "being in position," "substance," and "quantity" in its middle section, which is typically called the "Praedicamenta."

Question: In a 1973 text, a philosopher argued that this theory produces the wrong "sort of considerations...into finding the answer" to problems posed by the examples of "Jim and the Indians" or "George and the arms manufacturers." Another objection to this theory is that it allows "no rest." In an adversarial collaboration with J.J.C. Smart, Bernard Williams stated that the day when people stop discussing this theory "cannot be too far off," and advanced the "integrity objection" to it. The fact that, for a population of at least 10 billion, there could exist some larger population whose sum-total existence would be better even though individuals had lives barely worth living is a simple formulation of Derek Parfit's counterexample to this theory dubbed the "repugnant conclusion."

Question: This book uses the fact that the Zulu term for "far away" is "a place where one cries 'mother, I am lost'" to illustrate its central observation that "the world is twofold for man in accordance with his twofold attitude." One section of this book begins by "contemplat[ing] a tree" that, on one hand, can be accepted as a picture, felt as a movement, assigned a species, stripped of its uniqueness, or dissolved into a number, or on the other hand, can be "drawn into a relation" with the observer. The contrast between "experience" and "encounter" is central to this book, which is divided into three sections of aphorisms and argues that an ideal society should be built on a person's relationship with others.

Question: In an anecdote illustrating this quality, the painter Apelles throws a sponge in frustration at his effort to paint the foam on a horse's mouth, only then succeeding in doing so. In The Will to Power, Friedrich Nietzsche denied that this quality equates with psychic health, because the desire for it is emblematic of nihilism and symptomatic of decadence. Michel de Montaigne's "Apology for Raymond Sebond" discusses how Zeno's conception of the division of the faculties of the soul as analogous to positions of his hand leads to belief in this "straight and inflexible" quality. Diogenes Laertius's story of a pig that ate calmly on a ship during a storm led Pyrrho to state that this quality was an ideal state of being in which people live in accordance with their nature. Sextus Empiricus said that it could be brought about by epoche, or suspension of judgment, and the Stoics associated it with apatheia.

This work draws a distinction between contemplation-based and practical-experience-based âsensuousnessâ in its critique of existing theories of materialism. This work, which was first published as an appendix to a pamphlet titled for a certain person âand the End of Classical German Philosophy,â was originally a sketch of the first chapter of its authorâs The German Ideology.

He defined beauty as "uniformity amidst variety" and said that a square was more beautiful than a triangle. This man's equation "B equals M over A" helps calculate the benevolence of an action as equaling the moment of good divided by our ability to do good. This author of Thoughts on Laughter described beauty as an instinct that is raised or triggered in us when we see a beautiful thing, and he compared the way we sense good and evil to the way we sense sweetness and bitterness. A sense of beauty and a moral sense were both described by this author, who wrote a materialist interpretation of Lord Shaftesbury's "universal benevolence" theory in his System of Moral Philosophy.

Question: This philosopher argued that finding out that gold is actually blue, not yellow, would not disprove the existence of gold, to demonstrate the yellowness is a "phenomenal" rather than an "essential" property of gold. He created an eccentric alteration of the addition operation called "quus" to illustrate his interpretation of an earlier philosopher's ideas on (*) rule-following. That interpretation of Philosophical Investigations appears in his Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language. Another of his works is a sustained attack on the theory that proper names function as definite descriptions, and invented a term for names that refer to the same thing in all possible worlds in which that thing exists.

His namesake law states that if two objects have exactly the same properties, then they are the same object. Those ideas are his Predicate-in-Notion Principle and his concept of the Identity of Indiscernibles. He posited the existence of simple substances that interact with each other via the Principle of (*) Pre-Established Harmony; said substances also being nonextendable, indivisible, and windowless.

It's not action, but this concept is divided into three different "formal" realms in Jürgen Habermas' "communicative" theory of it. Max Horkheimer argued that this collapses when it emphasizes the means to a goal in his critique of its "instrumental" variety.

While demanding praxis, this book denigrates enrichment through action alone as mere activism; instead, it calls for the creation of so-called codifications through reflective, dialogic participation in the structure at the center of the author's system, the culture circle. A strong critique of what it calls the "banking model," this work instead demands the ability to read the world, as well as the word, through a model that treats the learner as a co-creator of knowledge.

Question: In one work, this person analyzed the meaning of the Hebrew word "t'shuvah," claiming that the connotation of "repentance" symbolizes the second title concept in the process of examining the first title concept. In another work, this writer examined the "enchanting character" of the title work for the "public teaching" and "secret teaching." In addition to writing Progress or Return? and On the Plan of the Guide of the Perplexed, this thinker criticized Xenophon's Hiero in the sections "Pleasure and Virtue" and "Piety and Law" in a work that also contains a chapter describing a debate between himself and Alexandre Kojève. That work is his On Tyranny. This philosopher and Joseph Cropsey edited History of Political Philosophy.

Question: In a 1973 paper, Donald Davidson argued that radical interpretation requires that one simultaneously provide a theory of meaning and a theory of this concept. Quine wrote a 1956 paper in which he examined the case of a citizen named Ralph and a mayor named Bernard J. Ortcutt as a way of explaining how quantification works over contexts relevant to these concepts; that paper is widely held to have originated the de re/de dicto distinction between two types of this concept. Saul Kripke postulated the existence of a bilingual Frenchman named Pierre who utters the sentences "Londres est jolie" and "London is not pretty," but does not know that Londres is London in order to illustrate a "puzzle" concerning this concept. The Gettier cases are intended to provide a counterexample to the claim that knowledge is equivalent to being in possession of a justified and true one of these.

Question: In a series of papers collected under the title Culture and Value, Wittgenstein wrote that these phenomena are "gestures" accompanied by symbolic occurrences. John Earman has constructed a Bayesian characterization of the most famous argument about these concepts, holding that the best-known work about them is an "abject failure." In a 1968 paper partially devoted to the refutation of an argument by Anthony Flew, Roger Swinburne argued that there could exist sufficiently strong historical evidence for these phenomena. The most famous argument against these phenomena establishes that "uniform experience" is a "direct and full proof" against them," which "cannot be destroyed... but by an opposite proof which is superior," and concludes that "mere reason" or personal testimony is insufficient to ever convince one of the truth of Christianity. For 10 points, identify these phenomena defined in Chapter 10 of Hume's Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding as a "transgression of a law of nature by a particular volition of the Deity."

Question: At the conclusion of one of his works, this thinker analogized his method to a man who uses a ladder to ascend to a high place, after which he kicks the ladder away, suggesting that after achieving its task the method could be discarded. Writing about this thinker, Roderick Chisholm argued that this thinker's most important contribution was a theory of signs which rejected the "indicative" sign but defended the "recollective" or "commemorative" sign. This non-Husserl thinker integrated the Ten Modes of Aenesidemus, intended to show how epoche could be achieved, into his major work, which also discusses various phrases such as "No more" and "Nothing should be determined" as manifestations of a certain attitude. In that work, this author of volumes collected as Against the Professors, divided philosophers into three types: "Academics" who have "asserted things that cannot be apprehended," "Dogmatists" such as Epicurus and the Stoics, "who think they have discovered truth," and those who are "still investigating," such as himself.

Question: A 1973 paper by Paul Benacerraf argued that a causal account of knowledge presents a problem for "platonistic" interpretations of these kinds of truths. A "fictionalist" account of this concept was formulated by Hartry Field, who also attempted a nominalist account of this concept in response to Quine's naturalistic account. A philosophical approach that held that this concept's core was fundamentally constructive was formulated by Brouwer and was known as intuitionism. A thesis according to which we ought to be ontologically committed to the existence of entities within this field of study because of this field's "indispensability" was formulated by Quine and Putnam. For 10 points, identify this field of human activity, which according to the Quine-Putnam thesis is indispensable to science, and which includes sub-fields such as set theory and functional analysis.

That philosopher with this surname also formulated what he called his "basic argument" against the possibility of moral responsibility, by attempting to show that in order to be truly morally responsible, one must have been one's own cause. Another philosopher with this surname coined the term "descriptive metaphysics," as a contrast to what he called "revisionary metaphysics," in his 1959 work Individuals. That thinker with this surname also authored the the essay collections Freedom and Resentment and Entity and Identity, as well as an analytic interpretation of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason titled The Bounds of Sense.

Question: In one paper, this philosopher endorsed a "convergence" variety of scientific realism, which he also divided into materialist and metaphysical varieties. This author of "Three Kinds of Scientific Realism," rejected what he called the Democritean and the Berkeleyan forms of eliminationism and promoted a "pragmatic pluralism" of ethical discourse in lectures collected as Ethics Without Ontology. This thinker attempted to demonstrate that a certain thought experiment is based on a "self-refuting supposition" in the first chapter of his Reason, Truth, and History, which opens with a memorable description of an ant tracing a portrait of Churchill in the sand. This philosopher argued that "psychological state does not determine extension" in a paper that aimed to show that its title concept was not "in the head" by positing a world in which water was not H2O but rather XYZ.

Question: In 2002, Huw Price established a center for the study of this concept at the University of Sydney. A form of modal logic whose operators reflect various aspects of this phenomenon was developed by Arthur Prior. Peter van Inwagen called himself a "threeist" in a paper that attempted to establish a theory of identity relative to this phenomenon via a thought experiment involving a "flatlander" version of Descartes. Section II of the Critique of Pure Reason, which is dedicated to this concept, calls it "nothing else than the form of the internal sense," rather than any "determination of outward phenomena," as well as "the formal condition a priori of all phenomena whatsoever." A famous argument about this phenomenon divides it into an A-series and a B-series, and argues that although the A-series is necessary for it to exist, the existence of the A-series leads to a contradiction, and therefore this phenomenon is illusory.

Question: In one work, this thinker explored Descartes' "project of pure enquiry" and its failure to provide an "absolute conception" of reality, and in another work, imagined that "the day cannot be too far off... in which we shall hear no more" of a certain philosophical doctrine. This thinker began with a "sub-Humean" model of motivation in a paper that concluded that only "internal reasons" rather than "external reasons" exist. This philosopher denied the possibility of doing moral philosophy from what he called an "Archimedean point," outside of all knowledge, and called morality, "the peculiar institution" that we "would be better off without," in his 1985 work Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy. In a notable paper, answered by a paper of the same title by Thomas Nagel, this philosopher used the story of Gauguin to argue that moral justifications are not independent of fortune.

Question: Using this rule allows one to add additional terms to the left-hand sides of hypotheses in the deduction theorem; in that case, the form of this principle used is known as Pierce's law. The so-called consequentia mirabilis relies only on this result. This is the first derived statement in the Principia Mathematica, which proves it by taking the disjunction of the modus ponens and modus tollens to yield "p implies q equals not p or q," then considering what happens if q is allowed to be p. Polyvalent logics are ones lacking this rule, and N-valued logics have versions of this rule applying to N minus one disjunctions of mutual exclusions. Sometimes confused with the principle of bivalence, this law was first stated in Aristotle's On Interpretation as the principle of non-contradiction. For 10 points, name this law of classical logic according to which "p or not p" is true for any p, since no other result is possible.

Question: This thinker's dialectic defines genuine knowledge to be not only a perfect correspondence with reality, but also universally agreed upon by all people, and therefore impossible. He rejected Kantian ethics, arguing for a morality that balances individual diversity of morals and commitment to the whole of humanity in his Soliloquies and in On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultural Despisers. He argued that different definitions of a word are interdependent due to the so-called unity of the word-sphere. His twin vocations can be seen in his Dialectic, or, The Art of Doing Philosophy and his Brief Outline for the Study of Theology. He argued that rules of interpretation must be universal across texts, must be non-linguistic, and must include interpretation based on the psychology of the author.

That text, which was published in 1842, was attacked the following year in an essay that summarized its position as saying "we must emancipate ourselves before we can emancipate others"; that essay claims that it is only "in the North American states" that this subject loses its "theological significance and becomes a really secular" one. Another text on this subject that was published a century later attacks such authors as Edouard Drumont and Charles Maurras, and distinguishes between "authentic" and "inauthentic" types of a certain individual.

Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam have argued that multiple realizability undermines this concept and preserves the autonomy of "special sciences." The "greedy" version of this concept is dismissed, while a more modest form is defended through the metaphor of a crane, in Darwin's Dangerous Idea by Daniel Dennett. Along with the analytic-synthetic divide, a semantic form of this concept is one of the "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" Quine claimed to have refuted.

Question: In a 1976, Michael Stocker condemned competing approaches to this theory as "schizophrenic" for failing to examine "motives and motivational structures." An agent-based variant of this theory that takes inspiration from Frances Hutchenson and James Martineau, among others, was developed by Michael Slote. A book advocating this theory begins by imagining a world in which science has been destroyed and subsequently revived, although it is practiced without true understanding, and argues that this is the situation of one particular branch of philosophy. The development of this theory was largely inspired by G. E. M. Anscombe's paper "Modern Moral Philosophy," and it looks back to concepts such as arete, phronesis, and eudaemonia.

Question: This philosophical position is explained in one work using a cylindrical toy filled with balls of various sizes and colors. This theory can be modeled by Newtonian forces operating as a sieve according to Elliot Sober, who critiqued a "would-be vampire [killer]" who likened it to Skinner's behavorism in a text co-written with Piatelli-Palmarini. An architectural term from renaissance archways was borrowed to describe a consequence of this theory by Richard Lewontin, whose "spandrels" were attacked in the aforementioned work by Jerry Fodor. A dubious argument found in Warrant and Proper Function uses some dude named Paul's encounter with a tiger to claim that this theory implies humans cannot evaluate truth; Alvin Plantinga thus declared it an argument against Naturalism.

Question: At one point, this work asks if putting a lustful man in front of a gallows and threatening to execute him could stop him from fornicating. Scholars cite this work using the Academy pagination numbers from 5:3 (five three) through 5:163. Three nameless Theorems in this book argue that "determining grounds for the will" can include the mere form in which a principle is posited, not just its matter. This work introduces its author's idea of the summum bonum as the joining of virtue with happiness. This work's conclusion notes that humans find awe in two things: "the starry heavens above, and the (*) moral law within," after showing that the title concept compels us to believe in God's existence, free will, and the immortality of the soul. This work is meant to establish, rather than delimit, the "pure" subtype of the title mental faculty.

Question: One philosophy of this name was called "concrete metaphysics" and discussed in its author's book Riddles of the Sphinx. That movement of this name was inspired by the lectures of William James and started by FCS Schiller. A letter on this movement insists that the author's student mistranslated Dasein as "human reality." That letter by Heidegger to Jean Beaufret was itself a response to a lecture to the Club Maintenant, whose title ends with this word. That lecture asserts "existence precedes essence" and was written by Sartre to show that his philosophy is one of these movements. In the Renaissance, this movement started as a revolt against scholasticism. For 10 points, identify this generic name of a group of movements which sought to establish a philosophy that centered on man.

Question: The paper "On Leaving Out What It Is Like" proposes that there is no a priori connection between low-level descriptions and high-level descriptions of this concept, which is the reason for the explanatory gap that was elucidated by Joseph Levine. A different paper tackling this phenomenon discusses Type-A, Type-B, and Type-C materialism in relation to various arguments about it, such as the conceivability argument. The smallest individual units of subjective experience that characterize this state were formally introduced in a paper by Daniel Dennett entitled "Quining Qualia." The characteristics of the relation of this phenomenon to subjective experience is part of its namesake hard problem. David Chalmers wrote a work examining its relation to the mind, and the experiences that a human being has as a result of this state is the center of discussion in Nagel's What is It Like to be a Bat? For 10 points, identify this psychological state of being self-aware of one's own existence.

Question: One text that tries to define this entity praises the example of a prince who repudiates the arrogant word "tolerant" and is an essay that argues that dogmas and formulas are tools that suppresses man's natural gifts. The author of Golgotha and Scheblimini represented a tradition that ran counter to this entity along with Vico and Herder according to a book by Isaiah Berlin. An analogy that mass culture is like a factory producing goods is central to a book that argued this tradition paved the way for the rise of Nazism; that book was written by Adorno and Horkheimer. "Dare to Know" and "Man's emergence from his self-imposed nonage" are two ways that Immanuel Kant defined this movement in a short work that asks what it is.

Question: One book on this topic proposes that a meaning theory of justification is necessary to lay a "logical basis" for this discipline. That work by Michael Dummett was a response to the tendency of many philosophers to regard it as useless. A book titled after this topic introduces the idea that substances are compound forms, which is termed hylomorphism. The view that logical positivists regard this discipline as illogical, meaningless and semantically incorrect is examined in the first chapter of Language, Truth, and Logic, which also calls for its dismantling. One book titled for this discipline distinguishes between potentiality and actuality and introduces its author's unmoved mover argument. This branch of philosophy is primarily concerned with first causes and being. For 10 points, identify this branch of philosophy, with a name suggesting its scope beyond that of physics.

Question: An updated version of this work's ideas arranges metaphysical assumptions, values, exemplars and symbolic generations as portions of a "disciplinary matrix." This book argues that reading the Principia is challenging today due to a "gestalt flip." It suggests that the "normal" type of a certain discipline is merely problem solving and that textbooks are only produced in the aftermath of the resolution of so-called "anomalies." A controversial thesis in this book argues that since there is no "neutral observation language," the title entities are caused by incommensurable events. This book explains that the title events are caused by the adoption of new world views in light of new evidence, which is termed a paradigm shift. For 10 points, name this book by Thomas Kuhn that attempts to explain the progress of science.

It was advanced by Shēn Bùhài, who wrote a now lost book called Shēnzi to apply its principles. It called for an emphasis on shù and also saw "fixing the standards" and "the people are one" stances supported by a man who suggested that all farmers who don't meant price quotas be enslaved. It was supported by a man who closely worked with the treacherous Zhào Gāo and had Fúsū commit suicide.

Question: One adherent of this philosophy wrote 211 mathematical proofs that focused on the material world called The Elements of Theology. This school's ideas were spread by a man who advanced the "sea-battle" argument in his treatise "On Interpretation." During the Renaissance, Marsilio Ficino wrote a six-volume treatise that reintroduced the ideas of this philosophy to the public. Ammonius Saccas taught one philosopher of this school, who wrote fifty-four treatises concerning topics such as "the One's" superiority over intellect. Those works were arranged by Porphyry and are called the Enneads.

Question: One theorist who argued against the cognitive abilities of these entities posited that researchers often incorrectly made the ontological, epistemological, psychological and biological assumptions. After the success of the GPS program, Herbert Simon predicted that by 1967, all theories of modern psychology would take the form as one of these constructs. Hubert Dreyfus argued that attempting to give these entities the ability to think is akin to practicing alchemy, and Dreyfus also wrote a monograph on what they still "can't do." The inability for these agents to understand is highlighted by the example of a human who uses English rules to translate Chinese characters; that example was proposed by John Searle.

One concept in this book is explained as possibly failing due to a lack of "uptake," such as the refusal of a bet. The example of naming a ship the Queen Elizabeth is described in this book as a "misfire," which lacks authority, as opposed to an "abuse." Those are ways in which this book's condition of being "felicitous" might not be met. This book divides a concept, based on whether it requires an effect in order to succeed, into illocutions and perlocutions, the latter of which might include alarming or persuading.

He claims that all theories about the actions of others will "find them consistent believers of the truths and lovers of the good" in his "principle of charity." An early book by this man states that belief-desire pairs are the combinations of propositional attitudes that constitute both the reasons and causes of actions. He proposed that, while all thought and action must be describable as physical events, there are no universal laws which can predict thought on the basis of physics, in his paper "Mental Events."

Question: Leszek Kolakowski referred to this man as a Jansenist Marxist, and this author of The Trial of Socrates is also the subject of an essay by Isaiah Berlin contained in Against the Current. This philosopher considered his own work an application of Vico's philosophy to Marxism, and one of his works attacked the 18th-century formulation of the title ideology as a "superstructure of lies." He referred to Zola as "the perfect representative of the buffoonery of those times," in an essay titled "The Dreyfusian Revolution," and edited the magazine Le devenir, which introduced the work of Marx to France. More notably, this author of The Illusions of Progress formulated his theory of the social uses of the myth of the "General Strike" in order to support anarchosyndicalist movements in a work which examines the responses to the application of force by dissident minorities against a dominant entity. For ten points, identify this thinker best known for his 1908 treatise Reflections on Violence.

Question: In a 1978 article, Daniel Dennett concluded that our concept of this phenomenon was incoherent and argued against the possibility of implementing this phenomenon as a computer program. In Naming and Necessity, Saul Kripke argued that this phenomenon was not "picked out by one of its accidental properties," but rather "by its immediate phenomenological quality," and that it was absurd to suggest that it could exist without being a mental state. An article by David Lewis drew on a theory by David Armstrong to characterize this phenomenon as "a state that occupies a certain causal role;" that paper called it a "non-rigid" concept and argued that "a credible theory of mind needs to make a place for both" the "mad" and the "Martian" varieties of this phenomenon. Richard Rorty's Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature imagines beings called Antipodeans who speak of this sensation in terms of the firing of C-fibers.

Question: One essay concludes by claiming this concept poses a problem between reconciling the internal view of self with the acknowledgement that "we are parts of the world" and accordingly do not have control over what we do. That essay cites ordinary citizens in Nazi Germany who were subjected to a test that citizens of other countries were not as an example of the "circumstantial" category of this concept. The essay that coined this term analyzed the difference between the remorse felt by a spectator of a car accident and the lorry driver who accidentally ran over a child, which is labeled as "agent regret." Thomas Nagel wrote a 1976 essay titled this concept, which was introduced in an essay analyzing how one could evaluate Gauguin's decision to abandon his family and become an artist. For 10 points, name this concept introduced by Bernard Williams to determine when an agent can be ethically blamed for an action whose outcome they did not have control over.

Question: This man's work Three Letters to Lamy was a rejection of the claim made by the title priest that this man's own Treatise on Ethics supported a quietist position. This philosopher attached a postscript to one of his works which chastised Robert Desgabets and Simon Foucher for failing to note that the work in question argued that the ideas we perceive exist in God, not in us. This philosopher's publication of his Treatise on Nature and Grace led him to an intellectual feud with Antoine Arnauld over God's role in creation. This philosopher's most famous work outlines the principal sources of human error, and describes the methods by which those errors can be avoided, and was followed by 16 "Clarifications," the penultimate of which was a restatement of this thinker's thesis that God was the only true cause. For 10 points, name the author of the book The Search After Truth, a French philosopher who formulated occasionalism.

Question: This philosopher criticized Herbert Spencer for his failure to produce a new synthetic philosophy in a work which analyzed the popular and the governmental tendencies in society. Another work by this thinker asked "Civilized societies are rich. Why then are many so poor?" in the opening chapter "Our Riches," and argued that the "Social Revolution" in addition to providing people with the title substance, must also satisfy "the need for luxury." This man was influenced by Thomas Huxley's article "The Struggle for Existence," and the research of Karl Kessler to write his most famous work, which formed the middle part of a trilogy with Fields, Factories, and Workshops and Ethics. That work was intended as a critique of bourgeois morality based on the evolutionary analysis of altruism. The author of Modern Science and Anarchism, for 10 points, identify this philosopher who authored The Conquest of Bread and Mutual Aid.

Question: This thinker defined the ethical as the affirmation or denial of certain choices according to their value for an individual rather than for a community, where the root of affirmation arises in the "preconscience," in his Eclipse of God. Paul Pfeutze argued that this man's pragmatism and dialogical philosophy are both centered on direct action rather than immaterial considerations in a work on this man and George Herbert Mead called The Social Self. In the essay "Religion and Modern Thinking," this man posits the need for discovered religion rather than invented religion, and in Images of Good and Evil he argues that "every ethos has its origin in a revelation." This man's most famous work was criticized for its romanticism by Walter Kauffman; that work formulated the dialogic principle and contrasted the "I-It" with the title form of encounter.

Question: Alvin Plantinga's essay "On Ockham's Way Out" discusses the proposition that this man "once existed" in reference to God's knowledge of the contingent future. John Broome used the example of this man as someone presented with incommensurable choice, and this man is compared to a "single individual" in the Upbuilding Discourses that preface another work. This man "gained the prescriptive right to be a great man" in a work that discusses his hiddenness rendering him "higher than the universal." This man's story is compared to Agnes and the Mermaid in that work, which claims that Hegel should have rejected this man as the "father of faith." This man's dilemma is central to a work whose three problemata question whether there is an "absolute duty to God" or a "teleological suspension of the ethical."

Question: This work discusses a "technique of mnemonics" in which man gains memory by experiencing a constant pain that becomes ingrained in his mind. The second part of this work opens by discussing the paradox that man is permitted to make promises but is naturally forgetful. This work laments the "internalization of man" by the state organizations, which force man to suppress his "instinct of freedom" and turn man against himself. This work notes the similarities in the German words for "debt" and "guilt" and argues that the origin of the title concept was found in the relationship between the creditor and the debtor. The second section of this work discusses "bad conscience," and the third part asks the question "What do Ascetic Ideals Mean?" The opening section of this work contrasts the "master" and "slave" types of the title concept. Consisting of three essays, this work begins with the quotation "We knowers are unknown to ourselves."

Question: This philosopher argued that the logical aspects of the mind-body problem would arise for any "computing system" that uses language and does not know about its own makeup in a paper titled "Robots." This thinker claimed that Euclid's 5th postulate is analytic in the paper "The Analytic and the Synthetic," which both defended the analytic/synthetic distinction and condemned it as relatively useless for the purposes of sciences. This philosopher attacked J.J.C. Smart's type-identity physicalism in his paper "Psychological Predicates," and argued for realism about mathematical entities in a thesis he co-formulated with Quine about their "indispensability." This thinker's primary contribution to the causal theory of reference was his concept of a division of linguistic labor, in which "experts" fix the extension of terms, leading him to conclude that "meanings just ain't in the head."

Question: The appendix to one work by this thinker argues against the brute fact theory to claim that there could be an explanation for why the universe is the way it is. In that work, this philosopher argued that different theorists have been "climbing the same mountain on different sides," and proposed what he called the "triple theory." That triple theory of this philosopher holds that to be right, an act must not be disallowed by "principles that are optimific, uniquely universally willable, and not reasonably rejectable," and is elucidated in his On What Matters. This philosopher's most famous work employs the mere addition paradox to formulate an anti-consequentialist argument according to which a society with high aggregate happiness due to a large number of people who are all miserable is paradoxically superior to a society with fewer people, all of whom have a high quality of life. For 10 points, identify this moral philosopher who formulated his famous "Repugnant Conclusion," in his magnum opus, Reasons and Persons.

Question: One of the methods in this work is applied to Plato's Theaetetus, producing two 3x3 grids, one with the numbers 1 through 9 and the other with the color sequence "RRBGGGRWW." This work dares its reader to "just try - in a real case - to doubt someone else's fear or pain," in response to the claim that "I can only believe that someone else is in pain, but I know if I am." In one section, this work considers the paradox that "no course of action could be determined by a rule because every course of action can be made out to accord with a rule." This work imagines that we could distinguish Olympic from military sharpshooting by analogy to related people's "family resemblances," and begins by asserting that while its opening quote from Augustine does describe a "system of communication," it doesn't include everything we call a language.

This work, which was attacked by James Fitzjames Stephen, outlines its "infallibility argument" by describing how Marcus Aurelius, despite his wisdom, engaged in persecution of Christianity. This work attacks the Christianity of its author's day for stagnating unchallenged, and advocates "pagan self-assertion." This work concludes by championing the "greatest dissemination of power" and "greatest centralization of information" possible, and it attacks Muslim countries for banning pork.

Question: Robert Stalnaker's influential paper "A Theory of Conditionals" contains a conclusion titled for "Empiricism and" these philosophical concepts. That paper argues that these concepts allow us to switch from belief conditions to truth conditions when it comes to evaluating conditional statements. One philosopher notable for his use of these concepts attacked three forms of "ersatzism," which held that these entities are abstract rather than concrete. The belief that these entities are concrete is known as modal realism, and was advanced by a philosopher who used quantification over these constructs in his analysis of counterfactuals, David Lewis. In Naming and Necessity, Saul Kripke defines his notion of the rigid designator as one that designates the same object in all of these. For 10 points, identify these philosophical constructs often attributed to Gottfried Leibniz, who argued in his Theodicy that we live in the best of all of them.

Question: This work equates objective presentation with physical definition, such as when it describes sexual intercourse as "the rubbing together of abdomens, accompanied by the spasmodic ejaculation of a sticky liquid," according to Pierre Hadot's book The Inner Citadel. This work warns its readers to let go of trifles and annoyances since "soon, you will be ashes, or a skeleton, and either a name or not even a name." It contains such slogans as "Do nothing at random" and "Erase impressions." Its author pits the atomism of its rival philosophy against the providence of his own, and argues that the latter wins out, making it pointless to try to act against the will of God.

Question: One work seeks to "un-mix" this entity from a related one and claims that qualititative multiplicity will eventually become dissociated from it. Shoemaker devised a world with three possible zones: A, B, and C, in order to argue that Platonism with respect to this is not a compelling argument. Extending F. H. Bradley's similar argument, one philosopher devised the A series and the B series in order to argue that the world of this entity is merely an appearance. In the tensed view of semantics, the truth value of propositions is dependent on this entity. JME McTaggart argued for the "unreality" of this concept, which Henri Bergson's duration links to free will.

Question: One chapter of this book states that sensibility is embodied by, but extends past, the nervous system. It argues that inner certainty of the self is not possessed by the "unhappy consciousness," the stage after Stoicism. The first chapter of this work explains that upon first perceiving a thing, one forms a "sense-certainty." Self-awareness requires fear according to one section of this work, which posits that self-consciousness needs an opposite in order to be complete before describing the interaction of a dependent and independent consciousness.

He introduced concomitant variations, residues, difference, and agreement as "methods of experimental inquiry." Another work by this thinker considers such compassionate dictators as Charlemagne or Akbar. He attacked the armchair physiology used to justify preventing the title group from trying things and argues that slavery still persists in the household due to marriage laws. This author championed his namesake methods of inductive reasoning in A System of Logic, was assisted by his wife Harriet Taylor in writing "The Subjection of Women," and came up with the "harm principle" as a guideline for when the state should restrict freedom.

He illustrated the concepts of doubt and belief by asking whether one should pay for a horse-car with a nickel or with five coppers. Another essay by this author contains a figure depicting a "parallelogram of forces." He defined firstness, secondness, and thirdness, as respectively ideas, brute facts, and habits, in a paper to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences called "On a New List of Categories."

In another essay, this thinker attacked a line of argument that concludes "reality is spiritual" and attacks the idea of "esse is percipi." The sentence "It is not raining, but I believe that it is" suffers from his namesake paradox. This author published the essay "The Refutation of Idealism" in the journal Mind, which he edited.

This work argues that, presupposing Grotius's just war theory, a conquering nation cannot gain power over the conquered nation, just like native kings of the British isles gained the throne after the Norman conquest. This work argues that there cannot be a rightful king since it is impossible to tell who the heir of Adam is to attack the contradictory propositions that man is un-free and that kings have a divine right to rule. This work argues that gold does not rot, thus it can be traded for material goods, and that picking an apple makes one its owner in a defense of landowners and private property.

Question: This practice had an analog in the cult of Cybele's practice of taurobolium, and this practice is advocated by the Right Ginza in Mandeism, which follows this action with a sacred meal. A reference to this practice "for the dead," is contained in 1 Corinthians 15:29, in which it is asked "if there is no resurrection, what will those do," to whom this has happened. That practice may originate in the rituals of the Orphic cult, which carried out this action to prepare their dead for the underworld. According to the Arians and the Donatists, this action was only efficacious if performed by someone who was of pure intention and belonged to the church, while leaders like Conrad Grebel and Felix Mantz argued that only an adult could undergo this ritual and denied its usefulness to infants. This practice is generally considered the first sacrament in Catholicism.

Question: This document was first cited by the Supreme Court in 1974's Storer v. Brown, which upheld a California law prohibiting independent candidates who had been members of a party for less than a year prior to an election from being on the ballot. Noting that "no man is allowed to be a judge in his own cause," this work offers up the example of legislation regarding debts, this work criticizes "theoretic politicians," who believe that material equality will lead to uniformity of opinion. This work defines its central concept as a group of citizens "united... by some common impulse," and argues that the two methods of "curing the mischief" of such groups are to remove its causes and control its effects. Addressed to the people of New York by James Madison writing as "Publius," this work concludes by arguing that the advantage enjoyed by a republic over a democracy is likewise enjoyed by a large republic over a small one. For ten points, identify this Federalist Paper which argues that "a well constructed Union," will "break and control the violence of faction."

Question: In the 1980s, Jeffrey Alexander relaxed this perspective's traditional assumptions to develop a "neo" version of it. Gabriel Almond adapted this perspective to political science in order to compare different political systems. An influential version of this perspective analyzed systems using five pairs of "pattern variables" such as "diffuseness and specificity" and "ascription and achievement." An essay by Kingsley Davis and Wilbur Moore used this perspective to propose a positive model of social stratification. This perspective dominated American sociology from the 1930s to the 1970s in part because it was supported by the theories of Robert Merton and Talcott Parsons. It considers society to be a biological organism consisting of interrelated parts. For 10 points, name this major macro-level sociological paradigm, one of the three dominant perspectives of sociology along with conflict theory and symbolic interactionism.

Question: One thinker with this surname critiqued the logical foundations of the Principia Mathematica and argued that the a priori is that "which is true no matter what," in his paper, "A Pragmatic Conception of the A Priori." That thinker with this surname distinguished between four modes of meaning: denotation, comprehension, signification, and intension, in his 1946 book Analysis of Knowledge and Valuation, and he further developed his idea of "conceptual pragmatism," in Mind and the World Order. Another thinker with this surname argued for a type-type psychophysical identity that he originated with David Armstrong in the paper "Mad Pain and Martian Pain," and defended his theory of modal realism in the 1986 book On the Plurality of Worlds. That thinker's best-known philosophical work uses possible-world semantics to analyze conditionals of the form "if p it would have been the case that q;" that book is Counterfactuals.

Question: One method for solving this problem relies on Chothia's finiteness hypothesis, and the CASP studies are conducted to evaluate different methods of solving this problem. In one approach to this problem, the frozen approximation is employed to simplify pairwise comparisons. In another, each position in the target is assigned to one of eighteen environmental classes based on criteria such as degree of exposure; both of these approaches are types of threading. Many programs used for this application, such as Rosetta, use rotamer libraries to simplify conformation sampling. The basic approaches to this problem are ab initio modeling, homology modeling, and fold recognition. This procedure has been straightforward for targets like GCN4, which contains a coiled coil, but can be more difficult for subjects with membrane-spanning domains. For 10 points, name this technique, which is used in the absence of crystallographic data to model the three-dimensional architecture of a certain class of macromolecules.

Question: State courts broke with existing legal precedent to uphold these policies in cases such as Los Angeles Investment Co. v. Gary and Fairchild v. Raines. They arose in response to the ruling in Buchanan v. Worley, and their legality was upheld by the Supreme Court case Corrigan v. Buckley, inspiring Charles Hamilton Houston to develop a strategy to fight them. After these policies were ruled not binding on their members, they were largely replaced by the strategy of blockbusting. The 1945 study Black Metropolis argues that these policies are responsible for preserving the ghetto. Horace Cayton claimed that at their height, they covered eighty percent of Chicago. By the time they were ruled unenforceable in Shelley v. Kraemer, they were responsible for most of the housing segregation in Northern cities.

Question: One story about this figure relates how he supposedly obtained the Perfection of Wisdom texts from the king of the nagas in exchange for teaching the king his philosophy. A central concept in this thinker's philosophy is the notion of pratitya-samutpada, or "interdependence," which characterizes conventional reality, and he advocated mahakaruna, or "great compassion," as a means of transcending samsara. According to this thinker, the true cause of suffering was ignorance, which could be overcome through the realization of the anatman, or "no-self," and he argued that in order to have svabhava, or "essence," a thing must have a non-relational identify. Since nirvana is conceived of in opposition to samsara, this thinker argued that nirvana was not utimately real, and neither is anything else, and advocated that ignorance be counteracted through meditations on sunyata, or emptiness.

Question: The opening section of this work notes that "for centuries philosophy has taught that there are four causes," and claims that "the causa efficiens... sets the standard for all causality." This work twice quotes Holderlin to say "But where danger is, grows the saving power also," and once more to remind us that "poetically dwells man upon this earth," linking the poetical to the ekphanestaton of Plato's Phaedrus. According to this work, the essence of the title concept lies in Enframing, and the etymology of the title concept as a term "for the arts of the mind," is explored in connection to the episteme, leading to the statement that the title concept is a mode of revealing.

Question: One method of generating one of these constructs is to use Thompson's Construction to create an intermediate structure, then construct the power set of those states. Every "intrinsic," or "minimal" one of these structures has an associated syntactic monoid, and these constructs are classified as either Moore or Mealy types depending on what sort of function gives their output. The Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm generates one of these constructs, which it uses to perform a string search. A set of symbols that brings one of these to an accepting state is said to belong to its language, and it is impossible to construct one of these objects, which does not accept a regular language as a consequence of the Pumping Lemma.

Question: An article titled after this objective argues for it by inventing the word "teavy" and posing the question "is this table teavy?." That article defends this position by claiming that "the expression of attitude" is best achieved by art and poetry, but not by confusing the domain of science with artistic expression - an error which Nietzsche avoids. The author argues that this is necessary by stating that there are two kinds of pseudo-statements - ones which contain a word erroneously believed to have meaning, and ones where constituent words are meaningful but put together in a "counter-syntactical way." Another book's first chapter is titled after this - that chapter considers the similar phrases "Martyrs suffer" and "Martyrs exist," and contrasts them with the phrases "dogs are faithful" and "unicorns are fictitious." The aforementioned article by Rudolf Carnap argues for this "Through Logical Analysis of Language", while the verification principle is used to argue for this in the first chapter of Language, Truth, and Logic.

The fifth chapter of this work contrasts "single-track" and "multi-tracked" concepts to explain its author's theory of dispositions. This work introduces one important concept by positing a visitor to Oxford who sees the buildings but asks "where is the university?" This work demonstrates an infinite regress to debunk the "intellectualist legend" that intelligent action is always preceded by theorizing, and it later suggests a solution to that problem in the distinction between "knowing how" and "knowing that."

Joad accused it of facilitating fascism. This work ends with a chapter entitled "Solutions of Outstanding Philosophical Disputes", which is mildly ironic, as it sparked a long-running philosophical debate that saw its author publish Foundations of Empirical Knowledge and defend his sense-data theory against the attacks found in Sense and Sensibilia by John Austen.

Question: This concept is a feature of matching models, in which it gives mathematical meaning to intuitive notions of the "thick market," where the benefits of trading are greater the larger the number of potential counter-parties with whom to trade. One well-known application of this concept is Krugman's 1991 paper entitled "[This concept] and Economic Geography," in which it is used to explain why economic activity in a sector or industry concentrates in particular locations when locations are identical ex-ante. This concept usually enters models through a fixed cost of production, which along with monopolistic competition gives firms market power and non-zero profits. This concept is in general rejected by data on economy-, industry-, and firm-level production, which produce parameter estimates closer to Cobb-Douglas, so its use is disputed despite that models which assume this are successful.

Thus, the ultimate foundation of knowledge is not metaphysically provable, but is instead "radically incapable of proof" and arises from environmental happenstance. That is the explication of this book's noted opening sentence, (*) "a philosopher is compelled to follow the maxim of epic poets and to plunge in medias res."

His lectures to visiting Hungarians on Sundays and Feast days were the origin of his namesake "Homilies." He opposed the ideas of Karlstadt and argued for a spiritual sense of duty or righteous conscience. He helped edit The Letters of Obscure Men, a satire against his granduncle Johann Reuchlin's ecclesiastical enemies. Known by the epithet, Praeceptor Germaniae, his work Common Topics in Theology was an extensive formulation of Protestant doctrine.

Question: Early in this work, the author distinguishes between Gluck and Gluckseligheit, though he concludes that neither can be universally valid as both rest on solely empirical principles. That discussion serves to explain the various characterizations of the "sensuous impulse" and deduces that moral law cannot contradict itself by abrogating the justifications of that impulse. In a section titled, "Deduction of Religion in General," the author requires that God produce a "complete congruency" between the moral law and the happiness of finite rational beings, asserting he must be "totally just." This work shows that a test of congruency does not hold for the doctrine of Original Sin, but it does not explicitly target Christianity.

Question: Spivak's definition requires that they admit a metric, but this is not really necessary for most purposes. The Nash embedding theorem states that those having metric tensors can be isometrically embedded in Euclidean space. They are typically required to be Hausdorff and second countable, but must always be locally Euclidean. The differentiable type has smooth transition maps, unlike the topological version, and the Riemannian type has a metric tensor. The Poincare conjecture states that all simply connected closed examples of these in 3-space are homeomorphic to the 3-sphere. FTP, name these mathematical objects coverable by many open sets homeomorphic to Euclidean space; generalizations of surfaces.

ANSWER: manifolds
