"n one novel, the former proprietor of this location plays a flute while sitting next to the fire-breathing archivist Lindhorst and the author Longus, who is creating dragons through his writing. This location is where the protagonist of another novel is tried for the crime of murdering the reflection of a girl using the reflection of a knife. A section of this horseshoe-shaped building that illustrates ""Cosmic Psychotherapy"" contains a mirror that causes the protagonist's self to be refracted into several chess pieces for an eternal game. In the first room of this location, the protagonist meets his school friend Gustav and hides in a treehouse after observing cars and other machines murdering men. In its last room, the protagonist is placed in the last act of Don Giovanni before Mozart reveals himself to be the jazz saxophonist Pablo. Its slogan is ""for madmen only"" and its price of admission is ""your mind."" For 10 points, name this location visited by Harry Haller in Steppenwolf.",0

Late in this novel, it is revealed that Berengar had enticed Adelmo to have sex with him, prompting the latter's suicide.
